# Overview
Welcome to the Team Titan PNW Airsoft website. This is a website for an airsoft team in Washington State. 
Over the last 2 years this team has continued to grow in numbers and in recognition. This website is meant to 
help the team direct inquiries and information about their team to anyone who is interested in joining their team. 

# Styling
The main styling aim I took when building this website was to make it feel like a video game menu. Inspired by games like
Call of Duty Ghosts, Batman Arkham Asylum, Unreal Tournament, etc. I attempted to give the user that same feel. My approach to
accomplishing this was to study the layouts of video game menu layouts and implement some common traits into this website. 

# Current State
Currently the Team Titan PNW website features the following pages:
Home
About Us
Contact Us
Events
Media
Meet The Team

As of right now the website is static with no backend data management or routing. This will be the next step of development. 

# Technologies Used
This website utilizes the following technologies:
React
GitHub


# Future Developments
Here are some things that I will be looking to implement in the future:
[] MongoDB for data storage
[] Interactive Calendar
[] Admin Log In page
[] Active Contact Us Page (currently this page is static. I will be implementing a way for inquiries to actually be sent to an email address)
