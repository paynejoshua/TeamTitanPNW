    <p class="aboutUs">
        Welcome to Team Titan. We are an airsoft team operating primarily out of the Northwest. Although we do have a team in Virginia(?). 
        We love this sport and believe everyone who plays should have fun and feel like they are part of a community. That is our mission. 
        To create a fun community of fellow airsoft players who love the sport and are willing to bring more people into it.

        What does H TAN H ENI TAE mean and how do you pronounce it?
    <br>
        Let's start with the pronounciation. It is pronounced EE TAHN  EE EHPEE TAHS. This is Greek for: "With your shield or on it." A common,
        famous, phrase amongst the Spartans. Usually said by mothers to their sons before they left for battle. It essentially means: "Fight until
        the very end."
    </p> 
    <br>
    <p class="aboutUs">

        Why did you choose this phrase?
    <br>
        Our team is based on Greek mythology. All of our callsigns are based in Greek mythology as well as our squads. Our team motto derives from 
        Greek history.
